## About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code is an annual coding event consisting of daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice problem-solving, learn new algorithms, and enhance coding skills.

## Structure  
Each day consists of two puzzles. The solutions for each day are organized into separate directories, named `dayX`, where `X` corresponds to the day number (e.g., `day1`, `day2`).
